# Welcome to NX-VIS Visualizer

**NX-VIS Visualizer** is a Python library that makes it easy to render [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) graphs as interactive HTML visualizations using the powerful [vis.js Network](https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/) library.

Whether you're analyzing social networks, exploring dependencies, or just want a dynamic way to view your graph data, NX-VIS Visualizer provides a simple bridge between your Python/NetworkX workflow and rich, interactive web-based graphs.

## Key Features

* **Simple Conversion:** Directly pass your NetworkX `Graph` or `DiGraph` objects.
* **Interactive Output:** Pan, zoom, drag nodes, and explore connections in the generated HTML.
* **Highly Customizable:** Leverage the full power of vis.js options to control layout, physics, node/edge appearance, interaction, and more.
* **Attribute Mapping:** NetworkX node and edge attributes (like `label`, `color`, `size`, `shape`, `title`) are automatically translated to vis.js properties.
* **Self-Contained HTML:** Generates a single HTML file that can be easily shared or embedded.
* **Jupyter Notebook Support:** Render graphs directly within your Jupyter notebooks.
* **Live Configuration (Optional):** Enable the vis.js configuration panel to tweak your graph's appearance in real-time.
